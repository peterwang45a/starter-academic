I am a final-year Ph.D. student in computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am advised by Prof. Yuxi Fu and Dr. Hongfei Fu. I am mainly interested in formal methods, aiming at proving system correctness by rigorous mathematical approaches.   Currently, my focus is on program verification and model checking (for probabilistic/concurrent programs).
